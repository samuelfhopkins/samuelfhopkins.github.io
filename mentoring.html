			<h2>PhD's at Howard</h2>
			I am happy to be the advisor of the following PhD students at Howard:
			<ul>
				<li>Caleb DeBose (PhD expected 2027)</li>
			</ul>
			If you're interested in working with me as a graduate student, do not hesitate to reach out. But to work with me, you must be a Howard math graduate student, which means that you must apply to the <a href="https://mathematics.howard.edu/academics/graduate-program">Howard math department graduate program</a>.
			<h2>REU at UMN</h2>	
			<p>In the summer of 2019, I was a mentor at the University of Minnesota <a href="https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~reiner/REU/REU.html">Combinatorics and Algebra REU</a>. I mentored a group consisting of Quang Dao, Julian Wellman, Calvin Yost-Wolff, and Sylvester Zhang. They wrote the paper <i><a href="https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~reiner/REU/REU.html">Rowmotion Orbits of Trapezoid Posets</a></i>.</p>
			<h2>RSI at MIT</h2>
			<p>In the summer of 2014, I was a mentor at the <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/rsi/">RSI program</a> in the MIT math department. There I mentored two high school students: Petar Gaydarov and Ingrid Zhang. With Petar, we wrote the paper <i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aam.2016.06.010">Parking functions and tree inversions revisited</a></i>. With Ingrid, we wrote the paper <i><a href="https://doi.org/10.37236/4641">A note on statistical averages for oscillating tableaux</a></i>.</p>
