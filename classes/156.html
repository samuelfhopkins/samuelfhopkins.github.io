					<td><h3>Course content:</h3></td>
					<td>We will study differentiation of algebraic and transcendental functions, applications of the derivative, differentials, indefinite integrals, and definite integrals. The goal here is developing the student's geometric insight into the concepts of differentiation and integration, and applying these concepts to problem solving and "real world applications."</td>

					<td><h3>Grading:</h3></td>
					<td>The grading for the course will be based on <b>Quizzes</b>, <b>Midterm Exams</b>, and the <b>Final Exam</b>. The grading scheme is: <ul> <li> Quizzes = 35% of grade </li> <li> Each of 3 midterms = 15% of grade </li> <li>Final exam = 20% of grade </li></ul> In-class <b>quizzes</b> will happen every Tuesday, except for weeks when midterms take place. There will be 11 quizzes and your lowest 2 scores will be dropped (so 9 of 11 count). Other problems for practice may be assigned but not graded. There will be three in-class <b>midterms</b> in the semester. They will take place on Tuesdays and be announced 1-2 weeks in advance. The <b>final</b> will happen after the end of classes, during finals week. <br> Studying with your fellow students is a good idea, but collaboration on graded assignments is not permitted. The use of calculators, outside notes, or other tools from the Internet, is not permitted. Grades will be posted to the <a href="https://canvas.howard.edu/courses/50190">Canvas site</a>. I may consider other factors, like class participation, when determining final letter grades, especially in borderline cases.</td>
