						<td> We will continue to study the enumeration of discrete structures, with a new focus on connections to algebra (a.k.a. symmetries!). We will try to cover the following: 
						<ul>
							<li> Group actions on combinatorial sets: 
								<ul>
									<li> orbits, stablizers, etc., </li>
									<li> Burnside's Lemma, </li>
									<li> P&oacute;lya-Redfield enumeration, </li>
									<li> the cyclic sieving phenomenon </li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li> Symmetric functions: </li>
								<ul>
									<li> the ring of symmetric functions and its bases, </li>
									<li> Schur functions, </li>
									<li> standard and semistandard Young tableaux, </li>
									<li> the Lindstr&ouml;m-Gessel-Viennot lemma and the Jacobi-Trudi formula, </li>
									<li> the RSK algorithm, </li>
									<li> plane partitions, </li>
									<li> (maybe) quasisymmetric functions, </li>
									<li> (maybe) representations of the symmetric group </li>
								</ul>
						</ul>
						But if there are any topics you are especially interested in (or <i>not</i> interested in), please let me know! I am happy to tailor this course to the interests of the students. Also, I will try to review all the necessary background (either from algebra or from combinatorics) as we go along.

						<td><b>Prerequisites:</b></td>
						<td>Calculus, linear algebra, undergraduate algebra (groups, rings, fields). <br> 
						It's helpful to have taken the 1st semester of grad combinatorics, but is not strictly necessary.</td>

						In the first semester we covered material from Chapters 1-5 (even though this was not the textbook for that semester). In this semester we will mostly study material from Chapters 6-8. </td>

Collaboration on the homework is encouraged, as long as each person understands the solutions, writes them up in their own words, and indicates on the homework page with whom they have collaborated.</td>
