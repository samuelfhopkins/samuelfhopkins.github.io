Problem 1 is worth 5 points, and Problem 2 is worth 5 points, for a total of 10 points. Remember to \emph{show your work} on all problems!

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $R$ be the region below the curve $y=\frac{1}{x}$ from $x=2$ to $x=3$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the volume of the solid obtained by rotating $R$ about the $x$-axis.
\item Compute the volume of the solid obtained by rotating $R$ about the $y$-axis.
\item Which of the solids from (a) and (b) above has a greater volume?
\end{enumerate}

\item A 10 meter cable hangs off the side of a wall. The cable has a weight of 15 newtons. How much work is done lifting the cable up the wall? ({\bf Hint}: since the problem gives you the \emph{weight} of the cable, and not its mass, you do not need to use $g=9.8 \; m/s^2$ anywhere.)

\end{enumerate}
