\begin{enumerate}
\item You currently have $\$100$ in an investment that pays continuously compounded interest with a rate of return of $10\%$ per year.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $f(x)$ be the function that tells you the amount in dollars of your investment at a time of $x$ years from now. Write the formula for $f(x)$.
\item Let $g(x)$ be the function that tells you the time (in years) at which your investment will have $x$ dollars in it. Write the formula for $g(x)$.
\item Sketch the graphs of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.
\end{enumerate}
