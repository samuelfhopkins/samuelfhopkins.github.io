Problem 1 is worth 5 points and Problem 2 is worth 5 points, for a total of 10 points. Remember to \emph{show your work} on all problems!

\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the curve in the plane given by $x^3 + y^3 = x - y$. Find the slope of the tangent line to this curve at the point $(x,y)=(0,0)$.

\item The area of a circular bacterial colony is growing at a rate of $10$ square centimeters per hour. At what rate is the radius growing when the radius is $2$ centimeters? {\bf Hint}: recall that the area and radius of a circle are related by the formula $A=\pi r^2$.
\end{enumerate}
