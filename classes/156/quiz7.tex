Problem 1 is worth 5 points and Problem 2 is worth 5 points, for a total of 10 points. Remember to \emph{show your work} on all problems!

\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the curve in the plane defined by $x^3 + y^3 = x - y$. The curve is graphed below:

\item The area of a circular bacterial colony is growing at a rate of $10$ square centimeters per hour. At what rate is the radius growing when the radius is $2$ centimeters? \\{\bf Hint}: Recall that the area $A$ and radius $r$ of a circle are related by the formula $A=\pi r^2$.
