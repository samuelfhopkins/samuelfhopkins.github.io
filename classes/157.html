					<td><h3>Grading:</h3></td>
					<td>The grading for the course will be based on <b>Quizzes</b>, <b>Midterm Exams</b>, and the <b>Final Exam</b>. The grading scheme is: <ul> <li> Quizzes = 35% of grade </li> <li> Each of 3 midterms = 15% of grade </li> <li>Final exam = 20% of grade </li></ul> In-class <b>quizzes</b> will happen every Thursday, except for weeks when midterms take place. There will be 11 quizzes and your lowest 2 scores will be dropped (so 9 of 11 count). Other problems for practice may be assigned but not graded. There will be three in-class <b>midterms</b> in the semester. They will take place on Thursdays and be announced 1-2 weeks in advance. The <b>final</b> will happen after the end of classes, during finals week. <br> Studying with your fellow students is a good idea, but collaboration on graded assignments is not permitted. The use of calculators, outside notes, or other tools from the Internet, is not permitted. Grades will be posted to the <a href="https://canvas.howard.edu/courses/41462">Canvas site</a>. I may consider other factors, like class participation, when determining final letter grades, especially in borderline cases.</td>

					Old final exams can be found on the math department website <a href="https://mathematics.howard.edu/resources">here</a>.<br>
					Course material for Calculus II from previous years can be found on Prof. Sitaraman's website <a href="http://nature-lover.net/math/c/oldcourse.html">here</a>.<br>
					<a href="https://activecalculus.org/single">Active Calculus</a> is a free, online textbook for learning calculus; it does not follow exactly the same outline as the Stewart book we are using, but content from Chapters 5, 6, and 8 there closely aligns with what we will learn this semester.</td>
