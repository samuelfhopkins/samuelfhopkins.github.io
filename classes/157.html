					<td>The grading for the course will be based on <b>Quizzes</b>, <b>Midterm Exams</b>, and the <b>Final Exam</b>. The grading scheme is: <ul> <li> Quizzes = 40% of grade </li> <li> Each of 2 midterms = 20% of grade </li> <li>Final exam = 20% of grade </li> </ul> In-class <b>quizzes</b> will happen every Thursday, except for weeks when midterms take place. There will be 12 total quizzes and your lowest 2 scores will be dropped (so 10 of the 12 quizzes will count). <br> There will be two in-class <b>midterms</b> in the semester. They will take place on Thursdays and be announced 1-2 weeks in advance. The <b>final</b> will happen after the end of classes, during finals week. <br> Studying with your fellow students is a good idea, but collaboration on graded assignments is not permitted. The use of calculators, outside notes, or other tools from the Internet, is not permitted. Assignments and grades will be posted to the <a href="https://canvas.howard.edu/courses/28354">Canvas site</a>.</td>
