Problem 1 is worth 4 points, problem 2 is worth 4 points, and problem 3 is worth 2 points, for a total of 10 points. Remember to \emph{show your work} and \emph{explain your answers} on all problems!

\begin{enumerate}
\item In this problem, let the universal set be $U=\{1,2,3,\ldots,10\}$, and let $A=\{1,3,5,9,10\}$, $B=\{4,5,6,7,10\}$,  $C=\{3,4,6,10\}$. List the elements of the following sets.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $A \setminus B$ \hfill (Note that the book uses the notation $A-B$ for this set.)
\item $A^c$ \hfill (Note that the book uses the notation $\overline{A}$ for this set.)
\item $(A\cap B) \setminus C$
\item $(A \cap B)^c \cup C$
\end{enumerate}

\item In this problem, there is a group of 120 students, of which 5 are taking French, business, and music; 20 are taking French and business; 30 are taking French and music; 15 are taking business and music; 60 are taking French; 50 are taking business; and 40 are taking music. {\bf Hint}: Example 1.1.21 in the book explains how to use Venn diagrams for this kind of problem.

\begin{enumerate}
\item How many are taking business and neither French nor music?
\item How many are taking French or business (or both)?
\end{enumerate}

\item List all the partitions of the set $\{a,b,c\}$.

\end{enumerate}
