Problem 1 is worth 4 points (2 pts each part), and Problem 2 is worth 6 points (2 pts each part), for a total of 10 points. Remember to \emph{show your work} and \emph{explain your answers} on all problems!

\begin{enumerate}

\item In a standard deck of Western playing cards, cards have two qualities:
\begin{itemize}
\item a \emph{suit}: Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, or Clubs
\item a \emph{rank}: 2--10, Jack, Queen, King, or Ace
\end{itemize}
There are $4$ suits and $13$ ranks, for a total of $4\times 13=52$ cards. A \emph{poker hand} consists of $5$ of these $52$ cards. We saw in class that there are $C(52,5) = 52!/(5! \cdot 47!)=2,598,960$ different poker hands.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A poker hand is called \emph{four of a kind} if it consists of all four cards of one rank, plus any other card. How many four of a kind hands are there?
\item A poker hand is called a \emph{full house} if it consists of three of the cards of one rank, and two of the cards of another rank. How many full house hands are there?
\end{enumerate}

\item \begin{enumerate}
\item How many rearrangements of the word LOLLYPOP are there?
\item How many rearrangements of LOLLYPOP start with a Y or end with a~P (or both)? \\ {\bf Hint}: remember the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, $\#(X\cup Y) = \#X + \#Y - \#(X\cap Y)$
\item How many rearrangements of LOLLYPOP have the two O's adjacent? \\ {\bf Hint}: to make the O's adjacent, you can treat them as a single character ``OO''
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
