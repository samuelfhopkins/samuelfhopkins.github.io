Problem 1 is worth 5 points and Problem 2 is worth 5 points, for a total of 10 points. Remember to \emph{show your work} and \emph{explain your answers} on all problems!

\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove the following: ``For any two real numbers $x$ and $y$, if $xy \geq 2$ then $x \geq \sqrt{2}$ or $y \geq \sqrt{2}$.'' {\bf Hint}: Use a proof by contradiction or a proof by contrapositive.

\item Prove the following: ``There exist irrational numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^b$ is rational.'' \\ Do this by employing the following {\bf proof strategy}. Show that either
\begin{itemize} 
\item $a=\sqrt{2}$ and $b=\sqrt{2}$ satisfy the statement;
\item or, $a=\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ and $b=\sqrt{2}$ do.
\end{itemize}
Your proof does not have to show \emph{which} of these two possibilities hold. You may use the fact we proved in class that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. You may also use the law of exponents $(x^y)^{z}= x^{yz}$.
\end{enumerate}
