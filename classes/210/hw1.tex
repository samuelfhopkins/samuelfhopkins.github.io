In all of these problems, $G$ denotes a group.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that $G$ is abelian if and only if $(ab)^2=a^2b^2$ for all $a,b\in G$. 
\item Give an example of a group $G$ and elements $a,b\in G$ with $(ab)^2\neq a^2b^2$.
\item Prove that if $a^2 = e$ for all $a\in G$, then $G$ is abelian (where $e\in G$ is the identity).
\end{enumerate}

\item Let $x\in G$. Prove that the cyclic subgroup $\langle x \rangle \subseteq G$ generated by $x$ is infinite if and only if $x^{i} \neq x^{j}$ for all $i \neq j \in \mathbb{Z}$.

\item Prove that if $G$ is finite and has even order, it contains an element of order $2$. \\ {\bf Hint}: Consider the set $t(G) = \{g \in G\colon g \neq g^{-1}\}$; show that $t(G)$ has an even number of elements and any non-identity element of $G\setminus t(G)$ has order $2$.

\item Consider the finite abelian group $G = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, with the group operation written additively as $+$. Write down the ``addition table'' for $G$, i.e., the table whose columns and rows are indexed by the elements of $G$, and with the entry in column $a$ and row $b$ being $a+b$.

\item Let $\sigma = (1, \, 2, \, 3, \, 4, \, 5, \, 6, \, 7, \, 8, \, 9, \, 10, \, 11, \, 12) \in S_{12}$ be a $12$-cycle in the symmetric group $S_{12}$. Write the cycle decomposition of $\sigma^i$ for each $i=0,1,\ldots,11$. What pattern do you notice? In particular, which powers of $\sigma$ are also $12$-cycles?

\end{enumerate}
