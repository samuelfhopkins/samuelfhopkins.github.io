Each problem is worth 10 points, for a total of 50 points. You have 80 minutes to do the exam. Partial credit will be given generously, so write as much as you know for each problem.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Give a specific example of a noncommutative ring $R$ (with a $1$). Show that your example really is noncommutative by exhibiting two elements $x,y \in R$ with $xy \neq yx$.

\item Recall that the ring of \emph{Gaussian integers} is $\mathbb{Z}[i] = \{a+bi\colon a,b\in \mathbb{Z}\}$ where $i=\sqrt{-1} \in \mathbb{C}$. Consider the ideal $I = \langle 2, \, 3+i \rangle \subseteq \mathbb{Z}[i]$. We proved that $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a principal ideal domain. Hence there exists an $r \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ for which $I = \langle r \rangle$. Find such an $r$. \\{\bf Hint}: how can the identity $(1-i)(1+i)=2$ help you?

\item (For this problem, recall $\mathbb{R}[x]$ is the one variable polynomial ring over the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$.)
\begin{enumerate}
\item State what it means for an element $p \in R$ of a commutative ring $R$ to be prime.
\item Is $x^2-1$ a prime element of $\mathbb{R}[x]$? Justify your answer.
\item Is $x^2+1$ a prime element of $\mathbb{R}[x]$? Justify your answer.
\end{enumerate}

\item Consider the following sequence of abelian groups and homomorphisms between them:
\[ 0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{g} \mathbb{Z} \to 0.\]
Here $f\colon \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ is given by $f(a) = (a,a)$, and $g\colon \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ is given by $g(a,b) = a-b$. Prove that this is a short exact sequence.

\item Recall for a commutative ring $R$ and an $R$-module $M$, its \emph{dual module} is $M^* = \mathrm{Hom}_R(M,R)$. Give a specific example of a commutative ring $R$ and an $R$-module $M$ such that $M$ is not isomorphic to its double dual $M^{**}$. Explain why your example works.

\end{enumerate}
