An \emph{isomorphism} between graphs $G$ and $H$ is a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of $G$ and of $H$ such that two vertices in $G$ are joined by an edge if and only if their corresponding vertices in $H$ are. If there is an isomorphism between $G$ and $H$ then we say that they are \emph{isomorphic}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item If $T$ is a tree and $G$ is isomorphic to $T$, must $G$ also be a tree?

\item\emph{Cayley's formula} says that the number of {\bf labelled} trees on $n$ vertices is $n^{n-2}$. But many of those labelled trees will be isomorphic. How many non-isomorphic ({\bf ``unlabelled''}) trees are there on $4$ vertices? On $5$ vertices? If you're feeling really bored: on $6$?

\end{enumerate}

The \emph{degree sequence} $(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)$ of a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is the sequence of degrees $\mathrm{deg}_G(v)$ for all vertices $v$ of $G$, written in non-increasing order: $d_1\geq d_2 \geq \cdots \geq d_n$.

\begin{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{2}

\item Explain why isomorphic trees have the same degree sequences.

\item Find two non-isomorphic trees with the same degree sequences.

\item Explain why the degree sequence $(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)$ of a tree $T$ on $n$ vertices is a non-increasing sequence of integers between $1$ and $n-1$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i = 2(n-1)$.

\item Can you show that any non-increasing sequence $(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)$ of integers between $1$ and $n-1$ with $\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i = 2(n-1)$ is the degree sequence of a tree on $n$ vertices?

\end{enumerate}

Recall that a \emph{spanning tree} of a connected graph $G$ is a subgraph that's a tree which contains all the vertices of $G$.
