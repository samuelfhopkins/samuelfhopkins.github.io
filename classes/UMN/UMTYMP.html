						<td><b>Course content:</b></td>
						<td>This is a course in discrete mathematics, including enumerative combinatorics, as well as some graph theory and optimization. We will try to cover as much of the textbook as possible, at the rate of about one chapter a week. There
will be an emphasis on reading and writing proofs. When you finish this class, you should be well prepared for upper-division mathematics courses. </td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td><b>Required text:</b></td>	
						<td><i>A walk through combinatorics</i>, by B&oacute;na, 3rd edition (although other editions should be ok). <br> Please contact me if you need help accessing the text.
						</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td><b>Course format:</b></td>
						<td> Class will be held once a week via Zoom. About half the class time will be spent on lecture, and the other half on working in groups on worksheets related to the material. I will post PDFs of the lecture notes, as well as the worksheets, on this page. The assignments will also be posted to this page. I plan to communicate with the class mostly via messages from Canvas (see below). <br>
						
						Although this will be the main webpage for the course, on the <a href="https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/205662">Canvas site</a> you can engage in discussions with me and with other students. We will also use Canvas for submission and return of assignments. You can also check your grades on Canvas. And recordings of the classes will be posted to Canvas. <br>
						
						If you have any suggestions for improving the class, please let me know! </td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td><b>Grading:</b></td>
						<td>The overall grade for the course will be computed as follows: <ul> <li>Homework = 40% of grade</li> <li>Each of 2 midterms = 20% of grade</li> <li>Final exam = 20% of grade</li></ul></td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td> </td>
						<td> Homework will be due on Tuesdays before class. There will be 5 homework assignments due usually every other week, but <ul> <li>2 weeks where there will be a week-long take-home midterm exam,</li> <li>a week at the end with a week-long take-home final exam.</li> </ul> Tentative dates for the assignments and exams are in the schedule below. <br>

I encourage collaboration on the homework, <i>as long as each person understands the solutions, writes them up in their own words, and indicates on the homework page their collaborators</i>. <br>

The take-home midterms and final exam are open-book, open-library, open-web, but in contrast to the homework on exams, <i>no collaboration or consultation of human sources is allowed</i> (except you can ask me, the instructor, questions for clarification). <br>

Late assignments will not be accepted. As mentioned, homework submissions will be via Canvas. <br>

Solutions should be well-explained; I won't give credit for an unsupported answer. Complaints about the grading should be brought to me. <br>

If you have a disability which requires accommodation, please let me know (and also contact the <a href="https://disability.umn.edu/">Disability Resource Center</a>). <br> <br> </td>
