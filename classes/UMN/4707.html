						<td>Office: No office this semester!<br> E-mail: shopkins@umn.edu&nbsp;</td>

						<td><b>Classes:</b></td>
						<td>Mon-Wed 2:30-4:25pm, on Zoom (see Canvas for link)</td>

						<td>By appointment, online</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td><b>Prerequisites:</b></td>
						<td>Math 2243 and either Math 2283 or 3283 (or their equivalent). Students will be expected to know some calculus and linear algebra, as well as having some familiarity with proof techniques, such as mathematical induction.  </td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td><b>Course content:</b></td>
						<td>This is a course in discrete mathematics, emphasizing both techniques of enumeration (as in Math 5705) as well as graph theory and optimization (as in Math 5707), but with somewhat less depth than in either of Math 5705 or 5707. <br> We plan to cover most of the required text (see below), skipping Chapters 6, 14, 15. <br> We will also supplement the text with some outside material (for instance, worksheets to be done in class-- see below).</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td><b>Required text:</b></td>	
						<td><i>Discrete Mathematics: elementary and beyond</i>, by Lov&aacute;sz, Pelikan, and Vesztergombi. <br> You should be able to access an online version of the text via the UMN library system.
						</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td><b>Course format:</b></td>
						<td> Class will be held twice a week via Zoom. About half the class time will be spent on lecture, and the other half on working in groups on worksheets related to the material. I will post PDFs of the lecture notes, as well as the worksheets, on this page. The assignments will also be posted to this page. I plan to communicate with the class mostly via messages from Canvas (see below). <br>
						
						Although this will be the main webpage for the course, on the <a href="https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/218751">Canvas site</a> you can engage in discussions with me and with other students. We will also use Canvas for submission and return of assignments. You can also check your grades on Canvas. And recordings of the classes will be posted to Canvas. <br>
						
						If you have any suggestions for improving the class, please let me know! </td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td><b>Grading:</b></td>
						<td>The overall grade for the course will be computed as follows: <ul> <li>Homework = 40% of grade</li> <li>Each of 2 midterms = 20% of grade</li> <li>Final exam = 20% of grade</li></ul></td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td> </td>
						<td> Homework will be due on Wednesdays. You will turn it in on Canvas. There will be 5 homework assignments due usually every other week, but <ul> <li>2 weeks where there will be a week-long take-home midterm exam,</li> <li>a week at the end with a week-long take-home final exam.</li> </ul> Tentative dates for the assignments and exams are in the schedule below. <br>

I encourage collaboration on the homework, <i>as long as each person understands the solutions, writes them up in their own words, and indicates on the homework page their collaborators</i>. <br>

The take-home midterms and final exam are open-book, open-library, open-web, but in contrast to the homework on exams, <i>no collaboration or consultation of human sources is allowed</i> (except you can ask me, the instructor, questions for clarification). <br>

Late homework will not be accepted. <br>

Homework solutions should be well-explained-- the grader is told not to give credit for an unsupported answer. Complaints about the grading should be brought to me. <br>

If you have a disability which requires accommodation, please let me know (and also contact the <a href="https://disability.umn.edu/">Disability Resource Center</a>). <br> <br> </td>
