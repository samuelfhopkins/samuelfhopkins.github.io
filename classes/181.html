					<td>The grading for the course will be based on <b>Homeworks</b>, <b>Midterm Exams</b>, and the <b>Final Exam</b>. The grading scheme is: <ul> <li> Homeworks = 40% of grade </li> <li> Each of 2 midterms = 20% of grade </li> <li>Final exam = 20% of grade </li> </ul> <b>Homework</b> problems will be assigned each Wednesday and due the next Wednesday, except for midterm weeks. There will be 12 total homeworks and your lowest 2 scores will be dropped (so 10 of the 12 will count). Barring exceptional circumstances, you must turn in your homeworks during class on Wednesdays. <br> There will be two in-class <b>midterms</b> in the semester. They will take place on Wednesdays and be announced 1-2 weeks in advance. The <b>final</b> will happen after the end of classes, during finals week. <br> Collaboration on homework assignments is permitted, as long as each person writes their own solutions and writes with whom they collaborated. The use of calculators (beyond "simple arithmetic") or other tools from the Internet, is not permitted. You may use your own notes and the textbook on the homework assignments, but the in-class tests are closed-book. Do not use your phone during class and especially not during tests.  Assignments and grades will be posted to the <a href="https://canvas.howard.edu/courses/29623">Canvas site</a>. </td>
