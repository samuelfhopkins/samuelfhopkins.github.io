						<td><b>Course content:</b></td>
						<td>In Discrete Structures, we will consider the basics of mathematical logic, set theory, and discrete mathematics (combinatorics and/or graph theory), and will learn to construct and write rigorous mathematical proofs.</td>

						<td><b>Textbook:</b></td>		
						<td><i>Discrete Mathematics</i>, 8th edition, by R. Johnsonbaugh.</br>

					<tr>
						<td><b>Grading:</b></td>
						<td>The grading for the course will be based on <b>Quizzes</b>, <b>Midterm Exams</b>, and the <b>Final Exam</b>. The grading scheme is: 40% Quizzes; 20% each of 2 Midterms; 20% Final.</td>

						<td>Take-home <b>quizzes</b> will be given each Monday and due the next Wednesday, except for the weeks with the midterms. There will be 12 total quizzes and your lowest 2 scores will be dropped (so 10 of the 12 quizzes will count). Additional <b>homework problems</b> will be assigned but not collected. <br> There will be two in-class <b>midterms</b> in the semester. They will take place on Wednesdays and be announced 1-2 weeks in advance. The <b>final</b> will happen after the end of class, during finals week. <br> Studying with your fellow students is a good idea, but collaboration on graded assignments is not permitted. The use of calculators (beyond "simple arithmetic") or other tools from the Internet, is not permitted. You may use your own notes and the textbook on the take-home quizzes. Grades will be posted to the <a href="https://blackboard.howard.edu/webapps/blackboard/execute/modulepage/view?course_id=_1141920_1&cmp_tab_id=_265616_1">Blackboard site</a>. </td>
