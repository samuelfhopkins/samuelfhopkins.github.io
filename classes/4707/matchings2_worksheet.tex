Your company has $10$ employees $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8,x_9,x_{10}\}$ and $10$ tasks to perform $\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5, y_6, y_7, y_8,y_9,y_{10}\}$, but each employee has a different set of tasks that they are capable of doing: 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c  c}
employee & tasks they can do \\
$x_1$ & $\{y_2, y_4, y_5\}$ \\
$x_2$ & $\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_5, y_6, y_7, y_8\}$ \\
$x_3$ & $\{y_2, y_5\}$ \\
$x_4$ & $\{y_2, y_4\}$ \\
$x_5$ & $\{y_4, y_5\}$ \\
$x_6$ & $\{y_1, y_3,  y_4, y_6, y_7, y_8\}$ \\
$x_7$ & $\{y_2,y_7,y_8\}$ \\
$x_8$ & $\{y_4,y_7,y_8\}$ \\
$x_9$ & $\{y_5, y_7, y_8\}$ \\
$x_{10}$ & $\{y_7, y_8, y_9,y_{10}\}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Match each employee to at most one task, so that different employees end up doing different tasks, in such a way that the maximum number of tasks are performed. Prove that your answer attains the maximum.

\medskip

{\bf Bonus problem}: come up with names for all the people and tasks (e.g., $x_1$ = ``Jarvis,'' $y_1$ = ``swap the decaf and caf labels on the coffee pots,'' $x_2$ =``Mildred,'' $y_2$ = ``make fax-machine noises in the printer room'').
